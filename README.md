# parametric-knob-maker
A specifically made script for generating fully customizable knobs for making toolless hex screws

# StoryTime
I needed a toolless screw for my previous project and I really don't like winged nuts. Also, they were sold out in my local hardware store, so I designed this OpenScad script. It can produce any screw knob in any size. It was a really fun project and I quite enjoyed it.


## easily create knobs with full customizable parameters
